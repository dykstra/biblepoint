Marriage
Marriage is like Christ and the Church [Ephesians 5:21-33] – The perfect circle.

[1 Peter 3:7] Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
[Colossians 3:18-19] Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them.
We must be selfless and sacrificial in marriage. By doing this, each spouse will feel their own importance, and love covers all. [1 Corinthians 13:4-7] Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
If the husband does his part, which is put his wife’s interests ahead of his own, and the wife does her part, which is being subject and respectful to her husband, it will be a perfect circle. We must always put our spouse before ourself, and always keep Christ at the center of your marriage. [Ephesians 5:21-33] Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
Don’t ever let the sun go down on your anger; reconcile your differences before you go to bed. [Ephesians 4:26] Be angry, and yet, do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger. Also, when you forgive, you forgive.  It should be forgotten, and not brought up again; otherwise it’s bitterness. [Hebrews 12:15] See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many be defiled.
We must ALWAYS seek to listen first. We need to ensure we’re communicating with our spouse daily; seeing what burdens he/she may be carrying. Otherwise, how can you help?! We should and must know our spouse intimately. [James 1:19] This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger
We need to always ensure we’re building each other up in Christ. [1 Thessalonians 5:11] Therefore encourage one another and build up one another.
Some other applicable verses to meditate on to encourage your marriage:
[Romans 14:19] So then we pursue the things which make for peace and the building up of one another.

[Proverbs 18:22] He who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the Lord.

[Proverbs 12:18] There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.

[Proverbs 16:23] The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds persuasiveness to his lips. Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones.

[Proverbs 29:11] A fool always loses his temper, but a wise man holds it back.

[Proverbs 18:13] He who gives an answer before he hears, it is folly and shame to him.

[1 Peter 3:3,4] [Wives] Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.
Remember, it’s about having Christ at the center of your marriage. He must be number one; with all focus on Him. In doing so, your decisions will be God honoring because He is your source.
