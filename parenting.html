Parenting
Train your children in the way of the Lord, and He will set their path straight. [Proverbs 22:6] Train up a child in the way he should go, even when he is old he will not depart from it.
Your kids will imitate your ways; both individually and how you act toward one another.  Be a light to each other and them. You should be constantly praying for them, and with them; praying together as a family. It’s never too early to be praying for their salvation. We should never concern ourselves with what age a child can display true faith; read and share with them from the beginning.
I encourage parents to shield their children at an early age from the bad things in this world.  Don’t buy into the talk about, oh they need to learn/be familiar with negative stuff to be strong, or they’ll see that kind of stuff sooner or later; that’s a terrible way to think and/or raise a child.  I’m a firm believer of what a person doesn’t know, he/she will not miss. Spend quality time with your kid(s), and focus on their biblical growth.
[Ephesians 6:4] Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[Proverbs 1:8] Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.
[Proverbs 1:10] My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
[Proverbs 29:15] The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
[Proverbs 3:11-12] My son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord or loathe His reproof; for whom the Lord loves He reproves, even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights.
[Proverbs 13:1] A wise son accepts his father’s discipline, but a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.
[Proverbs 19:13] A foolish son is destruction to his father, and the contentions of a wife are a constant dripping.
[Proverbs 19:20-21] Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days. Many plans are in a man’s heart, but the counsel of the Lord will stand.
[Proverbs 23:25] Let your father and your mother be glad, and let her rejoice who gave birth to you.
[Proverbs 19:26-27] He who assaults his father and drives his mother away is a shameful and disgraceful son. Cease listening, my son, to discipline, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.
