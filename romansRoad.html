What's the Romans Road? It’s the Gospel of Christ.
[Romans 3:10] As it is written, “There is none righteous, not even one.” –We must first understand our sinful nature, and that no one is free from that.
[Romans 3:23] For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. –God is perfect and holy.  We fall short of His holiness; born into sin.
[Romans 5:8] But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we yet sinners, Christ died for us. –In His gracious love, God sent His only Son to die the sinner’s death on our behalf.
[Romans 6:23] For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. –God, in His mercy is giving all who believe in faith the free gift of eternal life.
[Romans 10:9-10] …that if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. –Confessing in faith that Christ is Lord, and believing that God raised Him from the dead, you will have salvation in Him.
[Romans 10:13] …for whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved. –No one will be turned away that calls on His name in faith.
