    <p>When sin entered the world, through Adam and Eve, there was a wall between us (sinners) and God (Holy without sin). All generations thereafter were born into bondage; enslaved to sin. <b>[Romans 5:12]</b> Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned.  No one was free from this; no one seeks righteousness.  Before Christ walked the earth, high priests made sacrifices to God for past sins committed.  God then sent His only Son, Jesus to die the sinner’s death. [John 3:16] For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. Christ was born of the virgin Mary; God in human form. [Matthew 1:18] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit  He was without sin; perfect and holy. [2 Corinthians 5:21] He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. Christ was crucified on the cross, paying for all sins that were ever committed; past, present and future. [1 John 4:10] In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  After Christ died on the cross, He was raised from the dead, and now sits at the right hand of God the Father. [Ephesians 1:20] Which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places.  To break the barrier between you and God, you must call out in faith and proclaim Christ as Lord.  Confess that you are a sinner in need of a Savior, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. <b>[Romans 10:9]</b> that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  You must repent and turn away from your sin/sinful ways and follow God. [Acts 3:19] Therefore repent and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. This does not mean once we receive Christ, we are sinless. We will all still struggle with sin while here on earth, BUT our conviction will lead to repentance; always attempting to glorify God with our ways. That said, we are NOT to mistaken God’s grace for weakness and continue in sin [Romans 6:15] What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!
    I pray for the lost, with hope that God will change their hearts. [Matthew 3:2] Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
    Remember, it’s all by God’s grace we have been saved.  Nothing we have done has earned favor in His eyes. [Ephesians 2:8-10] For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
